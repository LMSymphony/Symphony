# How to Build Graviton

This guide provides instructions on how to build the Graviton application from source.

## Summary of Steps

1.  **Install Prerequisites**: This includes Node.js, Rust, and other tools.
2.  **Platform-Specific Setup**: Install dependencies required for your operating system (Windows or Linux).
3.  **Build the Application**: Use `pnpm` to install dependencies and build the app.

## 1. Install Prerequisites

You need to install the following tools to build Graviton. If you already have them installed, you can skip to the next section.

-   **Node.js (LTS)**: Required for the frontend and build scripts.
    -   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   **pnpm**: A fast, disk space-efficient package manager. Install it after Node.js.
    ```shell
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
-   **Rust**: The core of Graviton is written in Rust.
    -   [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   **Tauri CLI**: The command-line interface for Tauri, the framework used to build the desktop app.
    ```shell
    cargo install tauri-cli --version "^1.0"
    ```
-   **Deno**: Used as a runtime for extensions.
    -   [Install Deno](https://deno.land/#installation)

## 2. Platform-Specific Setup

Follow the instructions for your operating system.

### For Windows ü™ü

1.  **Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools**:
    -   Download and run the [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-studio-build-tools/).
    -   In the installer, select the "C++ build tools" workload and ensure the "Windows 10 SDK" is selected.

2.  **WebView2**:
    -   WebView2 is required for Tauri to render web content. It's pre-installed on Windows 11 and recent versions of Windows 10.
    -   If you don't have it, download and run the [Evergreen Bootstrapper from Microsoft's website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section).

3.  **Rust (MSVC toolchain)**:
    -   When installing Rust, ensure you select the MSVC toolchain as the default. The installer should detect this automatically. The triple will be something like `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
    -   If you already have Rust installed, you can set the default toolchain by running:
        ```shell
        rustup default stable-msvc
        ```

### For Linux üêß (Debian/Ubuntu based)

1.  **System Dependencies**:
    -   Open a terminal and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
        ```shell
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
            build-essential \
            curl \
            wget \
            file \
            libssl-dev \
            libgtk-3-dev \
            libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
            librsvg2-dev
        ```

## 3. Build the Application

Once you have all the prerequisites installed, you can build the application.

1.  **Install Project Dependencies**:
    -   Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run:
        ```shell
        pnpm install
        ```

2.  **Build for Development**:
    -   To run the application in development mode with live reloading, run:
        ```shell
        pnpm run dev_desktop
        ```

3.  **Build for Production**:
    -   To create a production-ready binary and installer, run:
        ```shell
        pnpm run build_desktop
        ```
    -   The output will be located in `desktop/src-tauri/target/release/`.
