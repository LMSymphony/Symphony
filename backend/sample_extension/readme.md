# sample_extension

To make Symphony run this extension follow the steps:

1. Create a directory in your user's HOME:
```
mkdir <YOUR_USER>/.symphony/extensions
```
2. Copy and paste this folder (`sample_extension`) into the directory created.

It must look like: 

```
<YOUR_USER>/.symphony/extensions/sample_extension
```

And finally, just run Symphony :-)
